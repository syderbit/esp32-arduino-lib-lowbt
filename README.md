# ESP32 Arduino Lib Builder

This repository contains the scripts that produce the SDK included with esp32-arduino. It not only supports local compilation but also provides an automated compilation and SDK download process through GitHub Actions.

If you want to directly use the precompiled SDK based on the branches below, please check the [arduino-esp32-SDK](https://github.com/esp-arduino-libs/arduino-esp32-sdk) repository.

## Feature

In comparison to the original [esp32-arduino-lib-builder](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-arduino-lib-builder), this repository is used for recompiling specific versions of the SDK in `arduino-esp32` and has the following branches:

* `release/*` is used to recompile the original SDK for a specified version.
* `debug/*` is used to recompile debug versions based on a specified SDK version.
* `high_perf/*` is used to recompile high performance versions based on a specified SDK version. It changes some configurations (as below) and can achieve higher performance in some cases, especially for avoiding [screen drifting](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-faq/en/latest/software-framework/peripherals/lcd.html#why-do-i-get-drift-overall-drift-of-the-display-when-esp32-s3-is-driving-an-rgb-lcd-screen) when using RGB LCDs.

  * For ESP32-S3 SoCs:
    * It changes the optimization level from `-Os` to `-O2` by enabling `CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_PERF=y`.
    * It increases the size of the data cache line from `32` to `64` by enabling `CONFIG_ESP32S3_DATA_CACHE_LINE_64B=y`.
  * For ESP32-S3R8 SoC:
    * It enables the function **XIP on PSRAM** by enabling `CONFIG_SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS=y` and `CONFIG_SPIRAM_RODATA=y`.

3. If you want to change the default configurations, follow the below steps:

  * Choose a branch based on the version you want to recompile. Here take `release/v3.0.0-alpha3` as an example.

  * To change the default configurations, mofify the files in the `configs` folder based on your application requirements.

    <img src="docs/_static/auto_step_2.png">

  * Commit the changes.

    <img src="docs/_static/auto_step_3.png">

  * Select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`, change the branch name if needed and click `Propose changes`.

    <img src="docs/_static/auto_step_4.png">

  * Do not create a pull request, just click `Action`. Here you can see the compilation process. (Default to compile all targets)

4. If you don't need to change the default configurations or just want to compile a specific target, follow the below steps:

  * Click `Actions` and enter the `Manual Build SDK For the Specific Target` workflow.

    <img src="docs/_static/manual_step_1.png">

  * Click `Run workflow`, select the branch and the target, click `Run workflow`. Then the compilation process will start.

6. To replace the original SDK, please refer to the [steps](https://github.com/esp-arduino-libs/arduino-esp32-sdk#how-to-use) for more details.

### Compilation in Local

1. Choose a branch version based on your application requirements and download it to the local.
2. Modify the files in the `configs` folder based on your application requirements.
3. Consult its README for compilation instructions. Note that the process involves downloading `ESP-IDF`, `arduino-esp32`, and several large components, which may take a considerable amount of time. Please be patient.
6. After the compilation is complete, the SDK will be located in the `out` folder.
7. To replace the original SDK, please refer to the [steps](https://github.com/esp-arduino-libs/arduino-esp32-sdk#how-to-use) for more details.
